# Boozy
## By Reid Boudreau and Kim Heidorn

### How do I play?
Below is a short clip of the game.

![Boozy Game Play]()

BUT in case you love reading, "Boozy" is a simple cocktail guessing game.
The user logs in and is presented with either ingredients and a recipe (easy mode)
or ingredients only (hard mode) and must guess the name of the cocktail. Users
aren't expected to know all 500+ drink names, so to help the user guess we provide
4 potential answers.
The one caveat, SPELLING MATTERS.

### How do I get the game?
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Using your terminal, navigate to the parent directory.
3. Run `bundle install` to download the required gem files.
4. Run `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` to build tables and populate the database.
5. Finally, to run the game type `rake run`.
